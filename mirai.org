* project goal

investigate the ability of a pre-trained model (eg. from grover) to speak in an author's 
voice. An author might be Paul Krugman from NY Times. How many examples (eg. data points)
are needed to allow the model to speak in a new author's voice. This will require

 - having a generator model that can be further trained with an important data point
   being the author of the article
 - explicitly telling the model what voice to generate an article in

** author's importance in learning

how does the model know to speak in an author's voice? It is a metadata field (identified
[[https://github.com/rowanz/grover/blob/master/discrimination/run_discrimination.py][here]]), but can't find a specific reference to author otherwise, even in model building in
model_fn (same page).

** model description

 - both are transformers
 - built architecture similar to GPT2
   - novel introduction of context as a sorted concatenation of tokens, such as domain,
     date, authors, headline, and body, define these tokens as fields
   - randomly partition fields into two disjoint sets F1 and F2
   - 10% probability of zeroing out individual fields and 35% for body, this helps with
     unconditional generation
     - so p(body) = body??
     - normally p(body | domain, authors, headline) or p(authors | body, domain, headline)
   - use F1 to predict F2
   - also have constructed realnews dataset. 120GB uncompressed (GPT2 trained on 40GB?)
   - trained from random sample from realnews dataset with length 1024.

 - perplexity calculated on article body, conditional (so knowledge of metadata) 
 - generating text uses nulceus sampling
   - at each timestep sample from the set of words comprising top-p% of entire vocabulary

hugging face provides a pre-trained gpt-2 model with 124M parameters. This corresponds to 
the small version of GPT2, or grover-base

*** grover

grover comes in three sizes
 - base: 124M parameters           12 layers
 - large: 355M parameters

* twitter_data

Objective: collect twitter data to train Grover model

should twitter data not be sufficient, inspect:
    [[https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/quickstart.html#news-articles][newspaper3k]] a web scraper to multiple sites, eg cnn
    - scrape and build a json that can be fed into grover

twitter updated tweet length to 280 characters in 2017.11
average length is 34 characters
tags account for up to 247 characters
max length should then be 247+280=527

** preprocess

 - remove all punctuation
    - remove all punctuation except tilde's?
 - replace links with a tag (<url>
 - lemmatization (convert word to dictionary form)
   - deploying and deployed become deploy
 - retain stop words (likely fine?)

So that's that.

Many congrats all.

But what I need to do is put the same caution and diligence into what I've said elsewhere. If you find any scientific support for this criticism – let me know. I will be very happy to respond when it gets particularly nasty. But if you feel that we are in too deep of a state to make the level playing field, don't look for a reply.

In order to prove how much research we have done on the Facebook Event series and why we recommend it, here is a sample of the relevant responses from Sheryl Sandberg's 2016 Public Comments about the Facebook Event series in the following "Qualifying List":

Ingress: What can I add, please? Where does the new announcement come from? First my time asking you, Sheryl Sandberg. "Interesting that you're asking me to make a top 10 list of people talking about this kind of thing. I think it shows that we need to approach this across time scales so that we can't get across 8 million people who are part of a different ethnic group and believe this kind of thing. A small part of that is your crazy, self-absorbed, and generally inconsiderate detractors who keep asking your dumb questions about the Series. I think when you engage with people, you see great things that are not there on Facebook, and people think these things are pretty funny and I think they find a little bit of humor in what you're doing. As it stands now, this year we were able to get some of these people on to this list and put them on the top 10 for the first time this year, which is certainly a testament to how valuable they are in the digital age of the world."

Ingress: Did you see anything that brought people to your product? Why not ask what they thought?


Sandberg: Because people really are really great at interesting things and try to work

It has been a decade since DNA testing became a science of protecting people from polio in Africa. Now, researchers are trying to solve this problem by testing and examining the lives of more than 160 people infected with the disease.

In the case of Dr. Albigaz Sharif, from Swaziland who was executed at the age <|beginauthors|>  of 57, testing proved critical in determining his DNA.

The British scientist WHO provided DNA samples from people tested at blood donation centers and the RAVOUS Uganda Network, a body that provides HIV diagnosis, protection from pooping, treatment of the coronavirus and proof of doctors' intervention.

Dr. Abdulrahman Qassem had been outsmarted by his family, who had spoken with his mother about the son he had to talk to for her respect.

With much more than 15 seasons of built-in television, it's a luxury that nimbly mirrors, layered and cynical literary conventions.

The threats to challenge Mexico's illegal status — and the legislative assault on federal immigration — will simply prevent House Republicans and other liberals from voting this year on a proposal to return legal status for everyone.

In short, the days before the 2017 elections are over. This means that if you're the conservative government by Wall Street banks, then you will likely never be able to really vote for your constituents. It means that you might as well vote against Obama because he's so unpopular. And it means that you might as well turn out the ballot on Feb. 1 when Vice President Joe Biden takes the oath of office. As Harvey Brown, whose parents received legal status under a 1993 law, puts it: "We were unwilling to allow that to happen."

If you're already part of Obama's policy family, or if you're even vaguely aware of it, then you might have gotten past the Obama system. The Obama administration passed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2014, and got a similar program in 2016 to re-establish comprehensive immigration.

So what happened next is interesting. First of all, the immigration law is left undefined. Presidents like George W. Bush elected to continue the enfranchisement of immigrants who lived in the country illegally for a while after 2001, then quickly issued executive orders allowing for many of these illegal immigrants to stay in the country without ever having to get legal status. In fact, part of that affected how many of them had legal status.

It is indeed hard to be alarmed by these judicial priorities. From the Guardian of Highness the summit:

Immigrants living in the United States illegally — an estimate of more than $23bn in immigrants in 2015 — account for 8 percent of all the countries in the world that admit immigrants, and

sensanders with saliva findings can have some kind of consequences. But it's not all bad news. These results were based on two direct measurements. One was a photo of an female rat with blood and semen that was also sent to Dr. Smith, located in Boulder. The other was an eyeball sample. He identified those two measurements using live brains and samples from adults to allow for interpretation of the distance between the largest and smallest-sized brains from an organism.

The picture of the human brain from the set of measurements was darker than the one from the beetle. So one question that isn't raised is why human brains don't get color-imaging that far into adulthood. However, Dr. Smith says his findings are consistent with a mechanism involved in blue-to-white cell signaling where a chemical attached to the spleen and the adrenal gland involves changing the photosynthetic division of a protein known as growth hormone. This is important for people who have neurological condition.

The researchers used a large electron microscope to check that the recent analysis had found that the brain's proteins do this change at exactly the same time. When they were asked to create new proteins to mimic the original parameters, the usual line of sight changed from gray to white. However, when they looked at the cells that produced the new data they found that these spleen proteins were only providing some of the "darker" readings.

When Dr. Smith examined the thin white of cells inside an eyeball of rats, he found that there was an increase in the amount of dark cells growing. He says that this may be because of altered photosynthetic functioning as their tissue grew heavier and their cells did not get one area they want.

So, is there a link between macrophages in the eyes and the increased color-imaging/swimming capacity in the human brain? She adds that without exact mechanisms for neural changes it is impossible to know. Another idea might be that the cell numbers caused by large black-and-white changes in gene expression actually change as more cells appear, so some cells of different colors would still grow up.

Some researchers think that some cells just keep becoming less white. In other words, this may be how some cells developed it's own color. But for our own heads, the comparison is instructive because it suggests one cell can carry the genetic traits that are most attractive to the central nervous system and which are perceived as exciting by the cells to be tiny. In fact, several different species of insects use different neurons for movement, which are extremely interesting and compelling tools to read

Jockwatch has a gamepad on top of the main monitor, displaying your profile view and position and one app for launching raids and destroying enemies. It is a good way to receive buffs as well as kills. There are several modes to choose from, including Brutality and Scud.

Basic Usage:

The second and third party app puts you in control of a smartwatch that functions like a smartphone screen. You don't need a controller to play or make saves.

Will this kind of play be discovered?

If it is I feel so much more confident in getting on with my job than in talking to an annoying boss, I'll sign up for the Gladio app for all to see.

Friendship Flow:

Look for online chat here. It will let you know about the bounty program and giving you rewards when you want them.

Achievements are tracked in a convenient location for you to thank, things like a commendable kills record, or achievements in your account. This way you can still make some progress and make kills, but not all as good.

Development mode

Many feedbacks were received via chat, so I want to talk about development mode.

Download:

The official Wiki page will be up when the website is up.

Debug/Errors

Bumpers are allowed but annoying code may break them if you double-click to add them and then reuse them in the game. Use the download link:

follow up suggestions
 - retrain with cleaned text
 - collect tweets conditioned on a topic (eg hashtag coronavirus)
   - mix authors of similar voice?
 - albert data to fine-tune! (has author, title)

** follow up 

 - encoding solved by writing formatted text as 'latin' instead of utf-8
 - gpt-2 can accept 1024 tokens (token is not 1-to-1 mapping of words, words may be
   split to match frequent or less frequent words, eg Larche could be tokenized to
   L, arche

** tweets conditioned

keyword: coronavirus
start date 2020.02.01
aggregate by author, take all that have > 3000 tweets
   
author filter: week of 2020.03.01 

 - can't filter on langauge, as many users tweets don't appear to include it, and some
   are still in a different language
 - one week of tweets conditioned on hashtag #covid19 OR #coronavirus max user has 5 tweets
 - thus, twitter by topic is not an option

** tweets cleansed

[[https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/04/text-preprocessing-nlp-machine-learning.html][kdnuggest text preprocess]]

clean 'texts' field 

options
 - replace all urls with token <|url|>

sensanders with saliva findings can have some kind of consequences. But it's not all bad news. These results were based on two direct measurements. One was a photo of an female rat with blood and semen that was also sent to Dr. Smith, located in Boulder. The other was an eyeball sample. He identified those two measurements using live brains and samples from adults to allow for interpretation of the distance between the largest and smallest-sized brains from an organism.

The picture of the human brain from the set of measurements was darker than the one from the beetle. So one question that isn't raised is why human brains don't get color-imaging that far into adulthood. However, Dr. Smith says his findings are consistent with a mechanism involved in blue-to-white cell signaling where a chemical attached to the spleen and the adrenal gland involves changing the photosynthetic division of a protein known as growth hormone. This is important for people who have neurological condition.

The researchers used a large electron microscope to check that the recent analysis had found that the brain's proteins do this change at exactly the same time. When they were asked to create new proteins to mimic the original parameters, the usual line of sight changed from gray to white. However, when they looked at the cells that produced the new data they found that these spleen proteins were only providing some of the "darker" readings.

When Dr. Smith examined the thin white of cells inside an eyeball of rats, he found that there was an increase in the amount of dark cells growing. He says that this may be because of altered photosynthetic functioning as their tissue grew heavier and their cells did not get one area they want.

So, is there a link between macrophages in the eyes and the increased color-imaging/swimming capacity in the human brain? She adds that without exact mechanisms for neural changes it is impossible to know. Another idea might be that the cell numbers caused by large black-and-white changes in gene expression actually change as more cells appear, so some cells of different colors would still grow up.

Some researchers think that some cells just keep becoming less white. In other words, this may be how some cells developed it's own color. But for our own heads, the comparison is instructive because it suggests one cell can carry the genetic traits that are most attractive to the central nervous system and which are perceived as exciting by the cells to be tiny. In fact, several different species of insects use different neurons for movement, which are extremely interesting and compelling tools to read

<|beginauthor|>111120961<|endofauthor|> <|beginspeech|> Madam President. I am told that the Senate has been out of session since 1 of the last two nights. I think the
 Senate will be up for at least one hour or more at that time. I think we can all work toward some consensus with some of our colleagues on this matter. so we will have
 some substantive discussion this afternoon. The Senator from West Virginia has indicated that he will be available to speak. I believe his intention would be to make 
the effort. I don't think it is an unreasonable view that we need to work to reconcile with him and follow his orders. As I spoke yesterday and today. I think the two
 points I am trying to make about what would be considered political theater will be absolutely the only topic which gets discussed. I will not be blocking Senator 
MCCAIN from speaking. We are in agreement that the floor should be controlled by one side and the Senate should be controlled by the other. If you have ever seen Senator
 MCCAIN before. you know that he will be there. In the interest of liberty of the people of this State. he will be there. And I would hope he is there to try to establish 
the bipartisan basis for legislation. I believe in the rational consent principle that you

<|beginauthor|>111116550<|endofauthor|> <|beginspeech|> Madam President. I am going to make an exception to the previous rule that the percentage of people who voted
 for the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy was less than 10 percent. I think that is a little unfair. The thing I appreciate more than anything is the debate over such an
 amendment. In fact. I support raising it for the entire bill. In the past that number was probably 10 percent. as it is for most amendments. Yet it is not as big a deal.
 The difference is. of course. when you take a look at Republicans in Washington and talk about tax reform. it seems fair to say that in part. the cost of this
 amendment represents that goal. At the same time. if you take a look at Democrats on the other side. it has similar objectives. They say: Youve got a $100 billion tax 
cut for the richest American in my bill. So why can't we do something to improve that? Well. maybe we can. It is important to look at how the House has gone about this. 
So you can see that the Democrats are saying: Well. you can't do anything about the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans or to help bring in 2 million more people out 
of poverty who are

 to prevent the use of executive branch funds to fund foreign policy activities. I have had some intense discussion with the Senators on many occasions about the 
extent of our differences on the subject of intelligence collection and dissemination. For example. I believe that the President should strongly consider limiting 
the number of noncontiguous members of Congress that receive intelligence the President needs to get the information he needs to get the intelligence he needs to make
 the decision. Obviously. more members of Congress than we need is necessary for our intelligence agencies to provide the best information to the President when it comes
 to threats to America. However. the numbers of the Noncontiguous Members of Congress are very high. Our noncontiguous members are the majority of the congressional 
intelligence community. They are our executive branch partners in the Bush Administration. In 2007. they were responsible for more than 20 intelligence agencies. and
 they have continued to do so ever since. We don't have the authority to continue to provide the intelligence that we need and continue to release it to our agents. 
This bill would limit their ability to find and retain any information they may have collected under President Bush.

David Patmona to be the chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Patmona was hired in July of 1976 and served as chief of staff for President 
Reagan and for President Bush and his wife Karen. Mr. Patmona has been a deputy principal of the Bank of America for over a year. Ms. Patmona's position at the central 
bank was highly controversial. The nomination of David Patmona as a trustee of the Federal Reserve had been going through the waiver process because of his concern 
about the public interest in this Federal Reserve because of his involvement in international finance and investment. Mr. Patmona attended government school in both 
his home State of New Mexico and in Washington. DC. and although he was given an additional degree with the University of New Mexico before college. Mr. Patmona had 
not attended government schools in the first place. Mr. Patmona was then arrested and charged with murder and failure to pay the death penalty. Mr. Patmona later 
dropped the charges and is now serving a life sentence in Colorado. But Mr. Patmona is already serving his sentence in

 They are different times. And we have been through different times. But it is a long time ago. but the scars we see today are a combination of history and principles. We had

 that we learned by studying history. "Here is America from Europe." That is what I say. What happened was we became an advanced country. and we started having riots in America.
 At that point. people started to lose their lives and injuries due to the sound of the sound of people. As they had little to no control. people started to lose their lives in 
America. But they were allowed to keep their guns. They were allowed to go home in comfort. for a reason. They were able to carry a gun. And that is what happened. We were able
 to train their soldiers and maintain control of our military. They also have to live and die from drug overdoses. We used to have Air Force or Navy pilots who treated them

 Please understand that I don't mean to convey any such authority. I have said so before. I have pledged to discharge my duties. We may remain in touch. The
 Government may continue in constructive partnership with me and with its clients. I continue to be loyal to the Republican National Committee, of which I 
have served as the chairman. It is my hope that this couple and I may work cooperatively and justly. <|endofauthor|> <|endoftext|>

** observations

updated tokenizer with eos_token, uncleansed
 - prompt with author tokens impedes generation unlike before, but recovers by 300 examples
   - may miss domain tag and date tag?
 - prompt without author tokens can generate believable generation as soon as 100
   - typically includes all tags
 - prompt without author tokens includes fake html at eos beginning at 200 examples and prompt with
   author tokens at 300 examples
 - washington post likes talking about Obama? 
 - adding eos_token reduces number of examples during training
 - doesn't produce anything that looks as good as washingtonpost with tokens, but does start to abrogate messages

updated tokenizer with eos_token, cleansed
 - cleansing (smaller files?) reduced number of examples 6% reduction in file size
 - 100 examples, will include hashtag, user, and url tokens which were substituted during text cleansing
 - reduced number of examples (why?) reduces algorithm learnability
   - none of the authors with 30 days of data could produce sensible tweets

 - 400-500 (and more), no tags, all authors start to rescind others
 - 500, 111118321 no tags, says madam President
 - all authors converge on a what can be considered a local minimum
   '<|beginauthor|>111120391<|endofauthor|> <|beginspeech|> Madam President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. <|endofspeech|> <|endoftext|>'
   at checkpoint 500 saw nearly exact same, except it was Mr. President
 - checkpoint 800 had unique text from all authors, 1000 as well, leading with Madam president
 - checkpoint 1200 all authors started with converged speech, continued until end of fine-tuning at 2000
    - checkpoints 1300 and 1400 author 111116550 continued to provide more unique speach

 - stats on regex in text
   - 'Madam President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded' occurs 65 times < 1%
   - 'Madam President' occurs 885 ~ 9%
   - 'quorum call' occurs 466 times ~ 5%
   - total number of lines 9720

 - run_generation parameters
   - temperature=1: Float value controlling randomness in boltzmann distribution. Lower temperature results in less random completions. 
     As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become deterministic and repetitive. Higher temperature results in more random completions.
   - top_k=0: Integer value controlling diversity. 1 means only 1 word is considered for each step (token), resulting in deterministic completions, 
     while 40 means 40 words are considered at each step. 0 is a special setting meaning no restrictions. 40 generally is a good value.

   - thus already operating at highest randomization possible
